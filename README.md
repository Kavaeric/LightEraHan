# Light Era Han

Converts between Japanese and the Light Era psuedolanguage, Han.

Han is a pseudolanguage I use in my worldbuilding project that's meant to match the aesthetics of CJK language and permit the use of CJK typography, but also as a means to express my own diasporic background and inability to read my own native languages.
